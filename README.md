# Console-Based C++ Hypergeometric Calculator

## What is this Project?

This project is a console-based hypergeometric calculator built with C++. It is functionally identical to the Java console-based hypergeometric calculator I wrote, which can be viewed here https://github.com/zmuranaka/hypergeometric-calculator-console. The README on that page explains more about what hypergeometric calculators are and how they are useful.

## How do I use the Program?

All you need to do is provide the population size, population successes, sample size, and desired successes, and the calculator will tell you what the probabilities are.

## Files:

deck.h  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This header file contains the class definition for the deck class.  
deck_functions.cpp  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This file contains the function definitions for all of the member functions prototyped in deck.h, except for the getters, which were defined within the header file.  
main.cpp  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This file contains the main function that actually runs the program.
