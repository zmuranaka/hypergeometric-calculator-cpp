# Console-Based C++ Hypergeometric Calculator

## What is this Project?

This project is a console-based hypergeometric calculator built with C++. It is functionally identical to the Java console-based hypergeometric calculator I wrote, which can be viewed here https://github.com/zmuranaka/hypergeometric-calculator-console.
